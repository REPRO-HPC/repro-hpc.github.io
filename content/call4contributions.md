# Call for Contributions


## Topic of Interests

The topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to, the following:

### General

- Feedback/Lessons learned/Success stories from artifact authors, reviewers, and chairs, trying to package an experiment or trying to reproduce an experiment
- Methods to create a "minimal reproducible experiment" to proxy the reproduction on the energy consuming full-scale version
- Energy-efficient artifact reproduction in HPC
- Case studies of sustainable (or unsustainable) artifact evaluation in HPC
- Long-term reproducibility: ensuring artifacts remain accessible and evaluable as hardware/software evolves
- Feedback from teaching HPC reproducibility principles
- Reproducibility in the age of AI: concerns and opportunities
 
### Software Environment / Workflow / CI/CD

- Methods and tools to create a standalone and portable experiments (package managers, containers,...)
- Methods and tools to support reproducibility in HPC from the early development stages (CI/CD, provenance, SBOM, ...)
- Methods and tools to support FAIR principles
 
### Platforms (HPC Centers and Testbeds)

- Tools and services that should be offered by HPC centers and testbeds to improve/support reproducibility
- Billing, access, and "security" to HPC centers and testbeds for reproduction attempts
 
### Artifact Evaluation Process

- Proposals for new Artifact Evaluation processes (timelines, badges, reports, interactions between authors and reviewers, reviewer roles, etc.)
- Incentives and recognition for Reproducibility in HPC (for authors and reviewers)
- Human-centric sustainability: reducing reviewer/author fatigue and chair workload
- Community standards for balancing rigor, efficiency, and human effort
- "Proper" evaluation of proprietary software/hardware
